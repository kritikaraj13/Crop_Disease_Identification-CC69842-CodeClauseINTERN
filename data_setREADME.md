**This project focuses on classifying diseases in potato plants through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By training a deep learning model on a dataset of potato plant images, the goal is to accurately identify and categorize various diseases affecting the crops.**

## Overview

Potato farming is vital to agriculture, but diseases can drastically reduce crop yields. This project employs deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs, to automate the detection and classification of diseases in potato plants. The resulting model serves as a tool for early disease detection, aiding farmers in making timely and informed decisions about crop management.

## Understanding CNNs
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep neural network designed to process grid-like data, such as images. They consist of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, which are highly effective in extracting features and recognizing patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes high-resolution images of both healthy and diseased potato plants. It is divided into training and testing sets to facilitate the training and evaluation of the CNN model. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadardiputra/potato-leaf-disease-dataset).
